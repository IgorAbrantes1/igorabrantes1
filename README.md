## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Igor Abrantes, am student and am in the 9th period of the Computational Engineering course at the Universidade Federal of Juiz de Fora (UFJF).

In addition to college studies, I'm taking a time to learn new languages and frameworks (PHP, Laravel and Bootstrap), with courses acquired on online teaching platforms and with real projects.

I'm a fast learner and also always want to learn about new technologies. I have always been very studious, especially when it comes to achieving my goals. And it's not/will be different when it comes to something I really like.

My English is basic, but I am looking to learn more and soon I will be improving this skill.
