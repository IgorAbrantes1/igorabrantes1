## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Public Information

My name is Igor Abrantes. I currently live in Juiz de Fora - MG, Brazil and am in the 9th period of the Computer Engineering course at the Universidade Federal of Juiz de Fora (UFJF).

In addition to college studies, I am taking a time to learn new languages and frameworks (PHP and Laravel), with courses acquired on online teaching platforms.

I am a fast learner, also hardworking and I always want to learn about new technologies. I have always been very studious when it's about achieving my goals. And it is not/will be different when it comes to something I really like.

My English is very basic, but I am looking to learn more and soon I will be improving this skill.
